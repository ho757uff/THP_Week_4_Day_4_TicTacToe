## Concept
This game is my personal attempt at creating a TicTacToe ruby game.

The rules are simple:
It is a 2-player game where each player takes turn to place their symbol on the board.
The first player to align 3 of their symbols in a row, column or diagonal wins the game.

## Features

- Automatic turn switch
- Automatic win detection
